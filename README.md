### Credit Management Website

---
This website was done as an internship task given by The Sparks Foundation (GRIPS) during August 2020.

It is a platform that provides a basic facility of transfering credits from one user to another with just some clicks. Get to know about the users whose credit you want to increase or decrease. Also, there is a functionality of transaction history which lets us know which user has lost or received how much credit amount and when.
